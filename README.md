# FPSO-vessel-failure_shape_test

We’re very excited about your application! As part of our selection process, we’d like to invite you to submit a solution for a technical test that simulates a real task at Shape.
In this assignment, you will get to know the industry we work in – don’t worry, no previous experience is required. The assignment involves an FPSO (Floating Production, Storage, and Offloading) vessel, and we need your help with an equipment failure problem. We hope this exercise will give you some insight into the challenges we face on a daily basis (for a reference of what is an FPSO, please check this LINK).

To enable the operations of an FPSO, we use sensors to make sure the equipment does not fail. These sensors measure different parameters of the equipment in different setup configurations (preset 1 and preset 2) over time. We want you to investigate one piece of equipment in different time cycles to understand what characteristics and parameters of the sensors might indicate that the equipment is on the verge of failing. To solve this problem, we expect you to answer a few questions regarding the attached dataset:

1. Calculate how many times the equipment has failed.
2. Categorize equipment failures by setups configurations (preset 1 and preset 2).
3. Categorize equipment failures by their nature/root cause according to parameter readings (temperature, pressure, and others).
4. Create a model using the technique you think is most appropriate and measure its performance.
5. Analyze variable importance.

Few Tips:

Please write down any insights and conclusions throughout your code when you think it is necessary, keeping them as clear and complete as possible. Think of this exercise as your first technical report for Shape!

At Shape, we generally work with Python, and you are encouraged to use this language. However, if you can't use Python, you can use R or Julia for this assessment. We value clean, concise, and production-ready code.

Once you’re done, please send us your analyses and answers in an Html notebook, but also other conclusions and insights that you think are relevant to the project. We value creativity!

Feel free to discuss how you think you would put the models in production.

What do we expect you to do:

* Present storytelling of data and analyses performed.
* Problem comprehension.
* Data exploration.
* Logic and concise model definition.
* Rationale explanation.
* Results evaluation.

What you DON'T need to do?
Super complex models with no logic or rationale behind them.

The deadline for submitting your response by replying to this email is four days after you receive it! If you need any extension, please, contact the talent team!
Once we receive your solution, we’ll review it and give you feedback within a week. If approved, you’ll be invited for a VC interview where you have the opportunity to explain to us the logic and techniques you applied and share your previous professional experiences.
Wish you the best of luck!
